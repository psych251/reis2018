## Introduction

### Background
Reis and colleagues (2018) report a series of experiments examining interpersonal influences on intellectual humility (IH)^[IH can be thought of as the awareness of one's epistemic limitations, i.e., to what extent you understand that your beliefs might be wrong or may change in the future.]. IH is typically construed as a stable cognitive trait. However, the authors hypothesized that priming the social cue of partner responsiveness would boost IH, because feeling understood may decrease people's propensity for self-enhancement and allow them to respond to their environment more openly. Study 5, which I will attempt to replicate, finds that priming partner responsiveness promotes a broader cognitive perspective (as measured in a global-local visual orientation task).

### Justification
Intellectual humility is my primary research focus. The affective roots of IH are incredibly understudied, and I am hoping to explore the roles of threat and competition (vs. psychological safety and trust) in enabling intellectual humility about morally divisive or identity-based beliefs. This is the most relevant paper in the extant literature, because it provides preliminary evidence that feelings of safety and support increase cognitive openness.

### Stimuli and procedures
Participants currently cohabiting with a romantic partner will be recruited from Prolific and randomized to one of two conditions^[Note that this differs from the original study, in which there was also a neutral control. However, I am underpowered to examine three conditions, and the original effect was only found between the responsive and unresponsive conditions.]: responsive or unresponsive partner. In the responsive (vs. unresponsive) condition, participants are asked to describe 2 (vs. 10) kind or considerate things their partner had done for them in the past week. It is generally easy to think of 2 such examples and harder to think of 10; this relative availability primes confidence or doubt in one's partner's responsiveness. Then participants will complete 16 trials of the global-local visual orientation task (see example image below). Finally, participants will complete the 20-item PANAS measure of mood, a potential confounding variable. I expect the study to be programmable in Qualtrics and to take no longer than 10 minutes per participant.

### Anticipated challenges
* Reaching appropriate power. The authors recruited 225 participants per condition (for a target of 188 after deletions) based on expected effect sizes. I may not have enough funding for 550 participants to take an 8-10 minute survey.
* Acquiring materials for the global-local visual orientation task. I may need to contact the authors to obtain the images they used and to see how they were displayed to participants. Hopefully I will not have trouble getting a response.
